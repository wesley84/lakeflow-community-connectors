Script to merge source files into a single deployable file.
Due to current limitations, the Spark Declarative Pipeline (SDP) does not
support module imports for Python Data Source implementations.

This script combines:
1. src/databricks/labs/community_connector/libs/utils.py (parsing utilities)
2. src/databricks/labs/community_connector/interface/lakeflow_connect.py (LakeflowConnect base class)
2b. src/databricks/labs/community_connector/interface/supports_partition.py (partition support mixins)
2c. src/databricks/labs/community_connector/interface/supports_namespaces.py (namespace support mixin)
3. src/databricks/labs/community_connector/sources/{source_name}/*.py (source library files, in dependency order)
4. src/databricks/labs/community_connector/sources/{source_name}/{source_name}.py (main source connector implementation)
5. src/databricks/labs/community_connector/sparkpds/lakeflow_datasource.py (PySpark data source registration)

Source library files (e.g., github_utils.py, github_schemas.py) are automatically discovered
and included before the main source file. The script analyzes import dependencies to determine
the correct ordering. Cross-file imports within the source directory are automatically removed.

Usage:
    python tools/scripts/merge_python_source.py <source_name>
    python tools/scripts/merge_python_source.py zendesk
    python tools/scripts/merge_python_source.py zendesk -o output/zendesk_merged.py
    python tools/scripts/merge_python_source.py all  # Regenerate all sources
