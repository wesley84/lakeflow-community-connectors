"""Tests for the OData LakeflowConnect connector.

Two layers:

* The class-based ``TestODataConnector`` runs the shared
  ``LakeflowConnectTests`` contract suite against the simulator at
  ``source_simulator/specs/odata/`` (Northwind-shaped Customers + Orders).
  This is what CI runs.

* The module-level ``@responses.activate`` tests below exercise narrow
  invariants of the connector that the contract suite doesn't cover:
  literal escaping, ``@odata.nextLink`` resolution edge cases, boundary
  trim shapes, auth wiring, and multi-schema disambiguation. They mock
  HTTP with ``responses`` and run independently of the simulator.

    """Contract test suite for the OData connector against the simulator.

    The simulator stands up a Northwind-shaped service at
    ``/odata/`` with a fixed ``$metadata`` document and Customers /
    Orders entity sets seeded from the JSON corpus. Connector reads
    flow through the simulator's custom OData handler (entity_set.py)
    which implements just enough ``$top``/``$skip``/``$filter``/
    ``$orderby``/``@odata.nextLink`` semantics to drive the suite.

    ``SupportsPartitionedStreamTests`` is mounted because the connector
    implements ``SupportsPartitionedStream`` (``PartitionMixin``). Its
    partitioned-table contract tests ``skip`` here — the connector only
    partitions *contained* N+1 snapshot paths (``Parent__Child``), and the
    flat Northwind corpus (Customers/Orders) has no partitionable table — so
    ``test_is_partitioned`` runs against the simulator while the contained
    partitioning behaviour is covered by the bespoke ``test_partition_*``
    tests below (which build nested ``$metadata`` fixtures the flat corpus
    can't express).
