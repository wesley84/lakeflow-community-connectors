"""OData v4 community connector for Lakeflow Connect.

Implements the LakeflowConnect interface for any OData v4 service. The
connector discovers tables and schemas from the service's ``$metadata``
endpoint, supports static auth (bearer / basic / api_key), connector-side
OAuth (auth_type=oauth2 — the connector mints and refreshes the token),
and UC-managed OAuth (the COMMUNITY connection runs the flow, refreshes
server-side, and injects ``access_token`` at query time), and ingests
each entity set either as a snapshot, an incremental CDC stream keyed
off a user-supplied cursor field, or (when the service supports it) a
server-driven delta query stream.

Connection options (set on the UC connection):
    service_url   required   OData service root, e.g.
                             https://services.odata.org/V4/Northwind/Northwind.svc/
    auth_type     optional   bearer | basic | api_key | oauth2 (omit for
                             the UC-managed OAuth connection mode)
    token, username, password, api_key, api_key_header
    oauth2_token_url, oauth2_client_id, oauth2_client_secret,
                  oauth2_scope, oauth2_access_token, oauth2_refresh_token
                  used when auth_type=oauth2 — client-credentials
                  (token_url + client id/secret) or authorization-code
                  refresh (add refresh_token, optional access_token)
    access_token  runtime-injected by a UC COMMUNITY OAuth connection
                  (community_oauth_flow=m2m/u2m) — never set by hand;
                  the connection is created with client_id,
                  client_secret, token_endpoint (and oauth_scope /
                  authorization_endpoint as the flow requires)

Per-table options (allowlisted via externalOptionsAllowList):
    cursor_field          column to drive incremental reads; absent → snapshot
    select                comma-separated $select projection
    filter                additional $filter expression
    filters_at            JSON object mapping contained segment names (or
                          zero-based indices) to per-segment $filter expressions
    page_size             $top per request; unset → 1000 under the default
                          client-driven pagination (auto/skip/keyset need a
                          $top to size pages). Only pagination=nextlink leaves
                          snapshot ingest without a $top (server default);
                          cursor/delta ingest defaults to 1000 either way
    max_records_per_batch cap rows returned per read_table call (default 10000)
    delta_tracking        disabled (default) | auto | enabled. Opt-in.
                          When the source honours ``Prefer: odata.track-changes``
                          (MS Graph, Dataverse, SAP S/4HANA Cloud …), the
                          connector reads via the OData delta link instead of
                          cursor filtering, and emits removals as in-band
                          ``_deleted=True`` rows. ``auto`` probes once per
                          table and falls back to cursor/snapshot if the
                          server doesn't acknowledge; ``enabled`` requires
                          support and errors if the server doesn't acknowledge;
                          ``disabled`` skips the probe entirely.

#     ``(k gt last)`` predicate on the ``$orderby`` key set. For servers
#     that page-limit a response but omit the continuation link.
#   * skip — ignore ``@odata.nextLink``; page via ``$top`` + ``$skip``.
#     The keyless fallback (entities with no unique sort key); O(n)
#     offsets and fragile under concurrent writes.
#   * auto (default) — follow ``@odata.nextLink`` while emitted; when the

#     keys) or skip seek until an *empty* page. This covers a server that
#     page-limits below ``$top`` while omitting the link, and one that

        "quiesce on end == start" contract only ever worked for empty

        therefore mark the first pass done (``{"snapshot_done": True}`` —

        previously CRASHED on its first or second trigger, so no working

        The REVERSE shape check runs as a side effect: under ``auto``, a
        non-empty fallback-shaped offset (``snapshot_done`` / ``cursor``, no

        ``$deletedEntity``-context entry (``@odata.context`` ending in

        most one server page; MERGE dedupes any overlap.

          the right offset).

        never incurs the extra request.
